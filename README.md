Based on the local time, the background colour of the textarea will change to indicate whether the time has past, current or future time.

  If the time has past, the background will be grey.
  If it is the current time, the background will be red.
  If time has not occured yet, background will be green.

This screenshot was take at 22:00, therefore, all the textarea backgrounds are grey.
